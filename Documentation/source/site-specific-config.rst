Site-Specific Configuration
***************************
A site might have compilers that Fab doesn't know about, or prefers
a different compiler from the Fab default. Fab abstracts the compilers
and other programs required during building as an instance of a
:class:`~fab.tools.Tool` class. All tools that Fab knows about, are
available in a :class:`~fab.tools.tool_repository.ToolRepository`.
That will include tools that might not be available on the current system.

Each tool belongs to a certain category of
:class:`~fab.tool.category.Category`. A `ToolRepository` can store
several instances of the same category.

At build time, the user has to create an instance of
:class:`~fab.tools.tool_box.ToolBox` and pass
it to the :class:`~fab.build_config.BuildConfig` object. This toolbox
contains all the tools that will be used during the build process, but
it can only store one tool per category. If a certain tool should not
be defined in the toolbox, the default from the `ToolRepository` will
be used. This is useful for many standard tools like `git`, `rsync`
etc that de-facto will never be changed. Fab will check if a tool
is actually available on the system before adding it to a ToolBox.
This is typically done by trying to run the tool with some testing
parameters, for example requesting its version number. If this fails,
the tool is considered not to be available and will not be used (unless
the user explicitly puts a tool into the ToolBox).

.. note:: If you need to use for example different compilers for
          different files, you would implement this as a `meta-compiler`:
          implement a new class based on the existing
          :class:`~fab.tools.compiler.Compiler` class,
          which takes two (or more) compiler instances. Its
          :func:`~fab.tools.compiler.Compiler.compile_file`
          method can then decide (e.g. based on the path of the file to
          compile, or a hard-coded set of criteria) which compiler to use.

Category
========
All possible categories are defined in
:class:`~fab.tool.category.Category`. If additional categories
should be required, they can be added.

Tool
====
Each tool must be derived from :class:`~fab.tools.Tool`.
The base class provides a `run` method, which any tool can
use to execute a command in a shell. Typically, a tool will
provide one (or several) custom commands to be used by the steps.
For example, a compiler instance provides a
:func:`~fab.tools.compiler.Compiler.compile_file` method.
This makes sure that no tool-specific command line options need
to be used in any Fab step, which will allow the user to replace any tool
with a different one.

New tools can easily be created, look at
:class:`~fab.tools.compiler.Gcc` or
:class:`~fab.tools.compiler.Icc`. Typically, they can just be
created by providing a different set of parameters in the
constructor.


Tool Repository
===============
The :class:`~fab.tools.tool_repository.ToolRepository` implements
a singleton to access any tool that Fab knows about. A site-specific
startup section can add more tools to the repository:

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: ToolRepository

    from fab.tools import ToolRepository

    # Assume the MpiF90 class as shown in the previous example

    tr = ToolRepository()
    tr.add_tool(MpiF90)   # the tool repository will create the instance

Compiler and linker objects define a compiler suite, and the `ToolRepository`
provides
:func:`~fab.tools.tool_repository.ToolRepository.set_default_compiler_suite`
which allows you to change the defaults for compiler and linker with
a single call. This will allow you to easily switch from one compiler
to another. If required, you can still change any individual compiler
after setting a default compiler suite, e.g. you can define `intel-classic`
as default suite, but set the C-compiler to be `gcc`.


Tool Box
========
The class :class:`~fab.tools.tool_box.ToolBox` is used to provide
the tools to be used by the build environment, i.e. the
`BuildConfig` object:

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: ToolBox

    from fab.tools import Category, ToolBox, ToolRepository

    tr = ToolRepository()
    tr.set_default_compiler_suite("intel-classic")
    tool_box = ToolBox()
    ifort = tr.get_tool(Category.FORTRAN_COMPILER, "ifort")
    tool_box.add_tool(ifort)
    c_compiler = tr.get_default(Category.C_COMPILER)
    tool_box.add_tool(c_compiler)

    config = BuildConfig(tool_box=tool_box,
                         project_label=f'lfric_atm-{ifort.name}', ...)

The advantage of finding the compilers to use in the tool box is that
it allows a site to replace a compiler in the tool repository (e.g.
if a site wants to use an older gfortran version, say one which is called
`gfortran-11`). They can then remove the standard gfortran in the tool
repository and replace it with a new gfortran compiler that will call
`gfortran-11` instead of `gfortran`. But a site can also decide to
not support a generic `gfortran` call, instead adding different
gfortran compiler with a version number in the name.

If a tool category is not defined in the `ToolBox`, then
the default tool from the `ToolRepository` will be used. Therefore,
in the example above adding `ifort` is not strictly necessary (since
it will be the default after setting the default compiler suite to
`intel-classic`), and `c_compiler` is the default as well. This feature
is especially useful for the many default tools that Fab requires (git,
rsync, ar, ...).

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: ToolBox

    tool_box = ToolBox()
    default_c_compiler = tool_box.get_tool(Category.C_COMPILER)

There is special handling for compilers and linkers: the build
configuration stores the information if an MPI and/or OpenMP build
is requested. So when a default tool is requested by the ToolBox
from the ToolRepository (i.e. when the user has not added specific
compilers or linkers), this information is taken into account, and
only a compiler that will fulfil the requirements is returned. For
example, if you have `gfortran` and `mpif90-gfortran` defined in this
order in the ToolRepository, and request the default compiler for an
MPI build, the `mpif90-gfortran` instance is returned, not `gfortran`.
On the other hand, if no MPI is requested, an MPI-enabled compiler
might be returned, which does not affect the final result, since
an MPI compiler just adds include- and library-paths.


Compiler Wrapper
================
Fab supports the concept of a compiler wrapper, which is typically
a script that calls the actual compiler. An example for a wrapper is
`mpif90`, which might call a GNU or Intel based compiler (with additional
parameter for accessing the MPI specific include and library paths.).
An example to create a `mpicc` wrapper (note that this wrapper is already
part of Fab, there is no need to explicitly add this yourself):

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: Defining an mpicc compiler wrapper

    class Mpicc(CompilerWrapper):
        def __init__(self, compiler: Compiler):
            super().__init__(name=f"mpicc-{compiler.name}",
                             exec_name="mpicc",
                             compiler=compiler, mpi=True)

The tool system allows several different tools to use the same name
for the executable, as long as the Fab name is different, i.e. the
`mpicc-{compiler.name}`. The tool
repository will automatically add compiler wrapper for `mpicc` and
`mpif90` for any compiler that is added by Fab. If you want to add
a new compiler, which can also be invoked using `mpicc`, you need
to add a compiler wrapper as follows:

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: Adding a mpicc wrapper to the tool repository

    my_new_compiler = MyNewCompiler()
    ToolRepository().add_tool(my_new_compiler)
    my_new_mpicc = Mpicc(MyNewCompiler)
    ToolRepository().add_tool(my_new_mpicc)

When creating a completely new compiler and compiler wrapper
as in the example above, it is strongly recommended to add
the new compiler instance to the tool repository as well. This will
allow the wrapper and the wrapped compiler to share flags. For example,
a user script can query the ToolRepository to get the original compiler
and modify its flags. These modification will then automatically be
applied to the wrapper as well:

.. code-block::
    :linenos:
    :caption: Sharing flags between compiler and compiler wrapper

    tr = ToolRepository()
    my_compiler = tr.get_tool(Category.C_COMPILER, "my_compiler")
    my_mpicc = tr.get_tool(Category.C_COMPILER, "mpicc-my_compiler")

    my_compiler.add_flags(["-a", "-b"])

    assert my_mpicc.flags == ["-a", "-b"]


TODO
====
At this stage path-specific compiler flags are still set in the corresponding Fab
steps, and it might make more sense to allow their modification and
definition in the compiler objects.
This will allow a site to define their own set of default flags to
be used with a certain compiler by replacing or updating a compiler
instance in the Tool Repository. There is some support for querying
path-specific flag from the site-specific config, but TODO #313
will make this much nicer.

Also, a lot of content in this chapter is not actually about site-specific
configuration. This should likely be renamed or split when updating
and refactoring the documentation.
